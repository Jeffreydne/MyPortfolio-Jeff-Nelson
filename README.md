## Credits

  This application was built from scratch. I have used many of the strategies taught by the excellent instructers at the UC Berkeley Extension Full Stack coding bootcamp. In this case I used variations of methods taught in unit 20, which deals with React and Vite npm.  Finally, I copied open source badges from Vedant Chainani at the website https://dev.to/envoy_/150-badges-for-github-pnk#contents
